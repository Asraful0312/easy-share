        Our mission is to provide a privacy-friendly and minimal sharing
        experience. All content is temporary — by default, your uploads expire
        after 24 hours, ensuring your data doesn’t linger online longer than it
        needs to.

        Built using modern technologies like React.js, Convex, and Cloudflare
        R2, and proudly hosted on Vercel — we're committed to performance,
        privacy, and simplicity.
